#Ivan's work description
This is a branch from the computer graphics(TDA362/DIT223) lab for the final project at Game Engines Architecture.
I am ussing the base rendering engine to create a complete game engine in 3D.

To check source code you can see the files at:
C:\Users\Ivan\Repos\lab_computer_graphics_1\lab5-rendertotexture

main class and scene creation: lab5_main.cpp

To open the project in visual studio please go 
to build\lab5-rendertotexture\lab5-rendertotecture.sln file 
and once opened select lab5-rendertotecture as default project in the Solution Explorer.


If you want to tun the exe file please go to 
bin\lab5-rendertotexture.exe
